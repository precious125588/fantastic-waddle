# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS FILE LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES
#
# 1. Every workspace (root, mias/) ships its OWN .npmrc with
#    legacy-peer-deps=true. npm only reads .npmrc from the CWD (and $HOME) —
#    NOT from a parent folder. `cd mias && npm install` therefore ignored the
#    root .npmrc, hit the jimp@1.6.1 peer conflict from @itsliaaa/baileys and
#    died with ERESOLVE. The old `|| true` hid that, so mias/
#    shipped with NO node_modules at all — which is what "wa-sticker and gktw
#    aren't installing" actually was.
#
# 2. Installs are NOT run with --ignore-scripts any more. sharp needs its
#    install script to fetch the prebuilt linux-x64 binary; skipping it and
#    rebuilding afterwards was the source of
#    "Cannot find module '../build/Release/sharp-linux-x64.node'".
#
# 3. `overrides` in each package.json pins wa-sticker-formatter's sharp to
#    ^0.35.3, so there is exactly ONE sharp in the tree (no nested 0.30 copy
#    that has no Node 22 prebuild and must compile from source).
#
# 4. No gktw install steps. @itsreimau/gktw does not exist on npm and
#    github.com/itsreimau/gktw is 404. MIAS falls back to raw Baileys, and the
#    adapter auto-detects a real helper package if one is ever provided via
#    GKTW_PACKAGE.
#
# 5. No `|| true` on installs. A broken install must fail the build here
#    instead of at runtime in front of your users.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# 6. The 2026-08-02 build failure ("Exit handler never called!" x2, then
#    ENOTEMPTY on /app/mias/node_modules/axios) was a killed npm leaving a
#    half-written node_modules that the next retry could not overwrite.
#    scripts/robust-install.sh now fully deletes node_modules between
#    attempts and de-escalates the heap instead of raising it. Every
#    dependency install below therefore runs in its OWN layer, with only the
#    manifests copied first, so a source-only change never re-runs them.

# Serialize npm and keep peer resolution consistent in every workspace.

# NOTE: the old "new-page" bot workspace has been removed from this project.
# Nothing below may reference it — a COPY of a deleted folder is a hard build
# failure on Railway ("new-page/package.json not found").

# Copy all source files last (node_modules are excluded via .dockerignore,
# so the installs above survive this COPY).

# Verify the sticker engine really works in every workspace. A build that
# can't make a sticker should fail here, not silently disable the feature.
