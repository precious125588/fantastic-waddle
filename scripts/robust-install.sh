# WHY: the Railway build died in `bash scripts/robust-install.sh mias` with
#
#   npm error Exit handler never called!          (attempts 1 and 2)
#   npm error ENOTEMPTY: rename '/app/mias/node_modules/axios' ->
#             '/app/mias/node_modules/.axios-cKqQ93Jn'   (attempt 3)
#
# Two separate problems:
#
#   1. "Exit handler never called!" is npm's message when its own process is
#      killed mid-install — on a Railway builder that is the OOM killer. The
#      old script ESCALATED the heap (2048 → 3072 → 4096MB) on every retry,
#      which makes an out-of-memory kill MORE likely, not less, and ran the
#      resolver with --maxsockets 4 so a ~1200-package tree with native
#      builds was extracted in parallel at peak memory.
#
#   2. The retries only deleted node_modules/.package-lock.json. The half
#      written node_modules from the killed attempt stayed on disk, so the
#      next attempt tried to rename an existing, non-empty package directory
#      and failed with ENOTEMPTY. Attempt 3 could never have succeeded.
#
# WHAT: de-escalate the heap, serialize extraction, and do a FULL clean of
#       node_modules (plus a per-attempt cache dir) between attempts. The last
#       attempt falls back to --ignore-scripts + targeted `npm rebuild`, so a
#       flaky native postinstall degrades instead of failing the whole deploy.
